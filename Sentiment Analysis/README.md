# Sentiment Analysis


The aim of this project is to first build sentiment analysis code via shallow Machine Learning models, then add Text Augmentation to improve the performance of the model and then clean and preprocess the data to improve more the model. 

## Data
The data can be downloaded here https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1b8MAiN-xBdk6scM-DnufkuijDZivZJqM.

At the end, we use deep learning algorithms (e.g., RNNs and variants, CNNs and variants, and/or transformers) to build a model on the same dataset and compare the results with the Shallow ML model.
