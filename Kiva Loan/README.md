# KIVA Loan

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a Kiva loan request will default or not.

Kiva Microfunds is a non-profit that allows individuals to lend money to low-income entrepreneurs and students around the world. Since starting in 2005, Kiva has crowd-funded millions of loans with a repayment rate of around 98%. At Kiva, each loan request includes both traditional demographic information on the borrower, such as gender and location, as well as a personal story, because Kiva wants lenders to connect with borrowers on a human level.

## Models

First we tried Tried a number of Shallow ML models on standardized pre processing and on feature engineering. Then we DL models using SimpleTransformers to select the best one.
